Hello, thanks for viewing my code. This is a coin flip application that allows the user to pick \'93heads\'94 or \'93tails\'94 as well as the number of coin flips. After the program will output what each result was followed bu how many times the users choice of \'93heads\'94 or \'93tails\'94 showed up, including a percentage of correct guesses. If you have any questions or advice please feel free to reach out!}
